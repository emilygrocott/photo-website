in portfolio add more links to more photos
    portfolio will be the menu to all of the photos
    separate photos and travels, random photos will be in photos and travels will have more specific places

when adding photos, add a feature that when you hover over the photos it says the place or a description

make the photos clickable? so when you click on the photo it expands

add featured photos to the home page

in about me, add more pictures of myself

possibly change color scheme, black and white could stay but play around with colors more

layout of the photos:
    either do one at a time or more of a collage look?
    make it different for photos/travels, maybe make travels look more like a postcard/collage 
        but don't want to have too much white space
    
add a feature when the user scrolls, my name shows up in the bottom right hand corner (make it more transparent)

make the menu bar stick no matter how far down the user goes

add a back to top button at the bottom of each page?

figure out spacing and centering - making everything centered seems too obvious, fnd a way to make everything flow 

make an icon -> DONE

want the navigation to be different on horizontal and vertical platforms

have some live photos/gifs kinda 

figure out ways to make the code more modifiable so when I change one thing I don't have to change it in every tab/.html file I have
future ideas:
    add a journal
